  - _getVersion:_ return the current version
  - _getJS:_ return a promise with a JavaScript file request
  - _getJSON:_ return a promise with JSON file request
  - _getScripts:_ return a promise, which perfoms a sequence load on _script url_ from first to last elemnt. after the files has been loaded the script can be initialized with an optional callback function _fn_
  - _getScriptCollection:_ return a promise, which performs a sequence load for each _scripts property_
  - _insertScript:_ insert a script element before body ends
